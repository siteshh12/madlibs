# &  If both bits are 1 then only result is 1 otherwise result is 0
# | If atleast one bit is 1 then result is 1 otherwise result is 0
# ^  If bits are different then only result is 1 otherwise result is 0
# ~  bitwise complement operator ֍ 1  0 & 0  1
# <<  Bitwise Left Shift
# These operators are applicable only for int and boolean types.
